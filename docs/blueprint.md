- Clinkerization Balancing: Adjust controls in high-temperature operations to lower energy demand and environmental impact, optimizing combustion using a generative AI tool.
- Quality Consistency Assurance: Detect fluctuations in inputs and provide proactive quality corrections, using a generative AI tool to maintain product quality.
- Alternative Fuel Maximization: Model diverse fuel combinations to optimize thermal substitution rates and reduce reliance on fossil fuels using a generative AI tool.
- Utilities and Material Handling Optimization: Predict and minimize energy consumption in utilities and optimize internal logistics flows.
- AI-Powered Dashboard: Provide an intuitive dashboard and anomaly warning system for critical equipment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#293462) to represent industrial strength and reliability. It provides a sense of stability, which is ideal for monitoring critical processes.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F4F8), which offers a clean, neutral backdrop to ensure the primary content and data visualizations stand out. This light background supports prolonged screen viewing, essential for operational oversight.
- Accent color: Electric Lime (#BEF264) to highlight important alerts and KPIs, guiding the user's focus to key information. It is especially helpful in a monitoring application where immediate recognition is needed.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern, objective, and neutral appearance suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, simple icons to represent different plant processes and data points. Icons should be monochromatic for clarity and consistency.
- Implement a clear, structured layout with distinct sections for real-time data, alerts, and controls. Prioritize critical information for quick access.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and data updates. Avoid distracting animations to maintain focus on the critical information.
