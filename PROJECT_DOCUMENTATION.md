# CementAI - AI-Powered Cement Plant Operations Dashboard

## Project Overview

CementAI is an AI-powered dashboard application designed for cement plant operations. It provides six key modules for optimizing various aspects of cement production:

1. Plant-wide Dashboard - Centralized view with AI-generated insights
2. Raw Material Optimization - Optimal blend composition recommendations
3. Clinkerization Control - Real-time kiln operation adjustments
4. Quality Assurance - Proactive quality fluctuation detection
5. Alternative Fuel Management - Sustainable fuel usage optimization
6. Utilities Optimization - Energy consumption reduction

## Key Features

### Dashboard Modules
- **Main Dashboard**: Plant-wide insights with anomaly detection
- **Raw Materials**: Optimizes material blends for energy efficiency
- **Clinkerization**: Controls high-temperature operations for efficiency
- **Quality Control**: Ensures consistent product quality
- **Alternative Fuels**: Maximizes sustainable fuel usage
- **Utilities**: Reduces energy consumption in plant utilities

### Technical Features
- Real-time Generative AI recommendations using Google Gemini
- Responsive UI with sidebar navigation
- Interactive data inputs for operational parameters
- Visual analytics and charts
- Cross-process optimization insights
- Role-based interface for plant supervisors

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 15.3.3
- React 18.3.1
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui component library
- Recharts for data visualization

### Backend/AI

- Implemented structured error handling
- Improved component organization and reusability

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture with:
1. **Frontend Layer**: Next.js React components
2. **API/Middleware Layer**: Server actions and form processing
3. **AI Processing Layer**: Genkit flows with Google Gemini integration
4. **Data Layer**: Form inputs and AI model responses

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using standard Next.js deployment processes. It requires:
- Google Cloud API key for Gemini AI access
- Environment variables for secure configuration
- Standard Node.js hosting environment

## Future Enhancements

1. Add user authentication and role-based access control
2. Implement real-time data streaming from plant sensors
3. Add historical data storage and trend analysis
4. Include mobile-responsive design enhancements
5. Expand to additional cement production processes
